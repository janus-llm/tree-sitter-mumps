Function Call
==================
  S var=$func(arg1, arg2)

(program
    (assignment
      (local_variable)
      (function_call
        (arguments

==================
Function Call vs. Special Variable
==================
  S var=$D
  S var=$D(arg1, arg2)

==================
Lvalue Assignment
==================
  SET $EXTRACT(A,B,C)="MUMPS"
