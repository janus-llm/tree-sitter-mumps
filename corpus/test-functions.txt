==================
Function Call vs. Special Variable
==================
  S var=$D

Lvalue Assignment
==================

==================
User Defined Function Calls
==================
 S VAR1=$$MYFUNC1("string")  ; Call a user defined function
 S VAR2=$$MYFUNC2^SOMEROUTINE("string")  ; Call a user defined function in a specific routine

==================
Function Call Without Return Value
==================
 DO MYFUNC1  ; Call a user defined function, purely for side-effects
